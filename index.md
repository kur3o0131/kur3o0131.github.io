### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-03-ryan-and-caliyann)

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn about a method of how to find the difference of days between two dates. It was interesting to learn about the actual calculation and functionality of the code needed to find this information.

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-ryan-cali)

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to code a very simple high low guessing game with a newly learnt coding function, if statements. I was able to write functions that checked for numbers in a certain range and output whether or not a player has guessed correctly or incorrectly.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-ryan-and-alexis)

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn how the game blackjack and its point system functioned. I wrote functions that allowed me to correctly output the correct number of points of any 2 card combinations and also output whether or not the hand was a bust or a win.
